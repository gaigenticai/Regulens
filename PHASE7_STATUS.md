- Uses role hierarchy for permission levels
- Supports temporary delegations
- Approval workflows for sensitive operations
- Complete audit trail with compliance reports

### Analytics Design
- In-memory storage with thread-safety
- Can be backed by database layer
- REST API for external consumption
- Real-time metrics collection

### Extensibility
- All engines support database persistence
- API handlers follow consistent patterns
- Modular design for future enhancements
