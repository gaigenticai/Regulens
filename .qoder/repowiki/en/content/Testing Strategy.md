## Introduction

The Regulens compliance platform employs a comprehensive multi-layered testing strategy designed to ensure reliability, security, and correctness across all system components. This testing framework encompasses unit tests written in C++, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using Playwright, specifically tailored for an AI-powered regulatory compliance system.

The testing strategy addresses the unique challenges of testing AI agents, agent collaboration, event-driven architectures, and complex regulatory workflows. It provides robust test infrastructure with mock services, isolated test environments, and comprehensive coverage of critical compliance scenarios.

## Multi-Layered Testing Approach

The Regulens testing strategy follows a hierarchical approach with four primary layers, each serving distinct testing objectives:
