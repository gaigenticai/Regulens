## Detailed Component Analysis

### Course Management System
The course management system provides comprehensive functionality for creating, managing, and organizing training courses. Instructors can create courses with detailed information including title, description, course type, difficulty level, duration, and pass threshold. Courses can be categorized by type (compliance, technical, regulatory, security, ethics, or general) and difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert). Each course consists of multiple modules that can contain various types of content such as video, text, interactive elements, quizzes, or documents. The system supports course prerequisites, allowing for structured learning paths where completion of one course is required before enrolling in another.

#### Course Creation Workflow

### Progress Tracking Mechanisms
The progress tracking system provides detailed monitoring of learner progress through training courses. It tracks overall progress percentage, modules completed, time spent, and quiz performance. The system displays a progress overview with key metrics such as overall progress, modules completed, time spent, and engagement score. Learners can see their progress through individual modules, with visual indicators for completed, in-progress, and not-started modules. The system supports sequential module access, where learners must complete prerequisite modules before accessing subsequent ones, ensuring a structured learning path.

### Certification Workflows
The certification system manages the issuance, verification, and management of training certificates. When a learner completes a course and meets the completion criteria (typically achieving a score at or above the pass threshold), they become eligible for a certificate. The system generates a unique certificate with a verification code that can be used to validate the certificate's authenticity. Certificates include key information such as the learner's name, course title, completion date, and score. The system supports certificate templates with different designs for various course types, and certificates can include QR codes for easy verification.
