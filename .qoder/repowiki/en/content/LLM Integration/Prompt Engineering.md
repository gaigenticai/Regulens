## Prompt Creation Strategies

### Multi-Provider Prompt Engineering
The system implements sophisticated prompt engineering strategies for both OpenAI and Anthropic LLM providers, with specialized approaches for different compliance use cases. For OpenAI integration, the system uses structured system prompts with specific temperature settings (typically 0.1-0.2) to ensure consistent and reliable outputs for compliance analysis. The anthropic_client components implement constitutional AI principles in prompt design, ensuring that all responses adhere to ethical standards and regulatory requirements.

For regulatory text analysis, the system employs a multi-step prompt strategy that combines context provision, specific instruction sets, and output formatting requirements. This approach ensures that the LLM focuses on relevant regulatory aspects while maintaining consistency across different analysis tasks. The policy_generation_service utilizes GPT-4 with low temperature settings (0.1) to generate precise compliance rules from natural language descriptions, ensuring minimal variability in rule generation.

### Function Calling Integration
The system implements advanced function calling capabilities that allow the LLM to interact with external systems and retrieve specific information. The compliance_functions library provides a suite of domain-specific functions such as search_regulations, assess_risk, check_compliance, and analyze_transaction. These functions are registered with the FunctionRegistry and made available to the LLM through structured function definitions that include parameter schemas, descriptions, and execution logic.

The function calling framework includes comprehensive validation of parameters, secure execution with timeouts, audit logging, and permission-based access control. When a function call is detected in the LLM response, the system validates the parameters against the defined schema, executes the function with appropriate context, and returns the results to the LLM for final response generation. This approach enables the system to perform complex compliance tasks that require access to external data sources and analytical capabilities.

## System Prompt Generation Methods

### Compliance Analysis Prompts
The system implements specialized prompt templates for compliance analysis that incorporate constitutional AI principles. For regulatory compliance tasks, the system generates prompts that explicitly require the LLM to consider legal accuracy, practical application, risk assessment, documentation requirements, and continuous compliance monitoring. The anthropic_client's create_constitutional_system_prompt method generates comprehensive system prompts that guide the LLM to provide analysis structured around constitutional principles such as autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and transparency.

For risk assessment tasks, the system creates prompts that require the LLM to evaluate multiple risk factors, consider both short-term and long-term consequences, and provide balanced analysis of risks and benefits. The prompts are designed to elicit detailed reasoning that can be audited and verified, ensuring that risk assessments are transparent and defensible.

### Decision Explanation Framework
The system implements a robust decision explanation framework that generates prompts requiring the LLM to provide clear reasoning for all conclusions. When analyzing regulatory changes or compliance requirements, the prompts structure the response to include identification of relevant principles, assessment of compliance with each principle, recommendations for improvement or mitigation, and clear reasoning for all conclusions. This approach ensures that decisions are not only compliant but also explainable and auditable.

For ethical decision-making, the system creates prompts that require the LLM to identify stakeholders, apply constitutional principles to each option, consider consequences, and recommend the most ethically sound course of action. The prompts are designed to prevent prompt injection attacks by strictly defining the response format and limiting the scope of acceptable responses.

### Constitutional AI Implementation
The constitutional AI implementation uses specialized system prompts that embed ethical and compliance requirements directly into the LLM's reasoning process. The create_constitutional_compliance_request function generates prompts that require the LLM to ensure all analysis and recommendations comply with legal and regulatory requirements, ethical standards, safety considerations, transparency, accountability, and fairness. These prompts are used for high-stakes compliance tasks where ethical considerations are paramount.

The system also implements constitutional AI principles for specific task types such as regulatory compliance, ethical decision analysis, and risk assessment. Each task type has a customized system prompt that emphasizes the most relevant constitutional principles while maintaining consistency with the overall compliance framework.

## Domain-Specific Prompt Templates

### Regulatory Text Analysis
The system implements specialized prompt templates for regulatory text analysis that are optimized for financial compliance domains. These templates include context about the specific regulatory framework (SEC, FINRA, CFTC, etc.), jurisdictional requirements, and industry-specific considerations. The text_analysis_service uses these templates to perform sentiment analysis, entity extraction, text summarization, topic classification, language detection, and keyword extraction on regulatory documents.

For regulatory change detection, the system creates prompts that focus on identifying effective dates, impact levels, affected entities, and compliance requirements. The prompts are designed to extract structured information from unstructured regulatory text, enabling automated compliance monitoring and reporting.

### Policy Generation Templates
The policy_generation_service implements domain-specific templates for generating compliance rules from natural language descriptions. These templates vary by policy domain (financial compliance, data privacy, regulatory reporting, etc.) and rule format (JSON, YAML, DSL, Python, JavaScript). The system uses GPT-4 to convert natural language policy descriptions into executable rule code, with confidence scoring and validation testing.

The prompt templates for policy generation include requirements for security, accuracy, and regulatory compliance, ensuring that generated rules are not only syntactically correct but also semantically valid and legally compliant. The system also generates alternative rule implementations and provides suggested improvements to enhance rule quality.

### Ethical Decision-Making Templates
The system implements specialized prompt templates for ethical decision-making that incorporate constitutional AI principles. These templates require the LLM to consider autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and transparency in all recommendations. For high-risk decisions, the prompts require the LLM to identify potential harms, suggest mitigation strategies, and provide clear reasoning for all conclusions.

The ethical decision-making templates are used in conjunction with risk assessment functions to provide comprehensive analysis of potential compliance violations and ethical concerns. The system ensures that all decisions are documented with complete reasoning trails, enabling audit and review.

## Common Issues and Mitigation

### Prompt Injection Prevention
The system implements multiple layers of protection against prompt injection attacks. The function calling framework validates all parameters against predefined schemas, preventing malicious input from altering the intended behavior. The system also uses input sanitization, context isolation, and response validation to ensure that prompts cannot be hijacked or manipulated.

For high-risk operations, the system implements additional validation steps that verify the intent of the request and ensure that all function calls are authorized and appropriate. The audit trail captures all prompt interactions, enabling detection and investigation of potential injection attempts.

### Response Quality Management
The system implements comprehensive response quality management through multiple mechanisms. The use of low temperature settings (0.1-0.2) for compliance tasks ensures consistent and reliable outputs. The system also implements confidence scoring, validation testing, and alternative generation to assess and improve response quality.

For critical compliance tasks, the system generates multiple response alternatives and uses confidence scoring to select the most appropriate response. The validation framework checks generated rules for syntax, logic, and security issues, providing feedback for improvement.

### Token Limit Management
The system implements sophisticated token limit management to handle large regulatory documents and complex analysis tasks. The text_analysis_service includes text normalization and summarization capabilities that reduce input size while preserving critical information. For large documents, the system implements chunking strategies that process text in segments and aggregate results.

The system also implements caching mechanisms that store frequently used prompt responses, reducing token usage for common queries. The openai_client includes token estimation and cost calculation features that help optimize prompt design for efficiency.
